## Features

### Basic Features

- **Spreadsheet Interface**  
  Provides a familiar grid layout that allows users to enter and manipulate data, similar to traditional spreadsheet applications.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**  
  Enables multiple users to edit the same sheet simultaneously. Updates are visible in real-time to all connected users, ensuring data consistency.

- **Cell Operations**  
  Supports updating cell values, viewing dependencies, and managing cell ranges for grouped operations, facilitating organized data handling.

### Advanced Features

- **Real-Time Chat**  
  Built-in chat feature for seamless communication between users.

- **Sorting and Filtering**  
  Multi-column sorting and flexible filtering options allow users to organize and display data in customized views. This feature is particularly useful for managing large datasets by focusing on specific values or sorting data hierarchically.

- Apache Tomcat server 
  
## Running the Application

After cloning the repository, navigate to the zipped folder structure containing the `client_setup` and `server_setup` folders. Follow these instructions to get the server and client running.

### Server Setup

1. **Requirements**:
   - Ensure that **Docker Desktop** is installed and running.

2. **Steps to Start the Server**:
   - Open the `server_setup` folder.
   - Double-click `run.bat` to start the server.
     - This script will build the Docker image, start the Docker container, and deploy the application on `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Verify that the server is running by opening `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser.

### Client Setup

1. **Steps to Start the Client**:
   - Open the `client_setup` folder.
   - Double-click `run.bat` to start the client application.
   - To open multiple clients, run `run.bat` again in a new window.
   - The client application will connect to the server running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Additional Commands (Optional)

- **To stop the server**, run:
  ```bash
  docker stop my-java-app-server
